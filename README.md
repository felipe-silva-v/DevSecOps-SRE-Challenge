## Part 1: Infrastructure and IaC

This section outlines the implementation of the cloud-based system for ingesting, storing, and exposing data as required in the challenge.

### **1.1 Infrastructure Design**
The following components were identified and implemented:

#### **1.1.1 Data Ingestion**
A Pub/Sub topic named `data-ingestion-topic` was created to handle data ingestion. Note that this implementation does not use Googleâ€™s managed Pub/Sub service but follows the Pub/Sub pattern.

#### **1.1.2 Data Storage**
A PostgreSQL instance was provisioned using Google Cloud SQL, configured with:
- PostgreSQL version 13.
- UTF8 encoding and collation set to `en_US.UTF8`.
- An admin user with a password for database management.

#### **1.1.3 Data Exposure**
An HTTP endpoint was deployed using Google Cloud Run to expose stored data. The endpoint is publicly accessible and serves as an interface for third-party consumers.

---

### **1.2 Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform**

Terraform was used to provision and manage the infrastructure. Below are the main resources and configurations:

#### **1.2.1 Terraform Resources**
- **Pub/Sub Topic**: Configured for data ingestion under the name `data-ingestion-topic`.
- **Cloud SQL Instance**:
  - Provisioned a PostgreSQL database with optimized settings for analytics.
  - Connection credentials were securely managed using Terraform outputs.
- **Cloud Run Service**:
  - A containerized API was deployed using an image hosted on Google Container Registry (GCR).
  - Configured with a 3600-second timeout due to limited internet connectivity in the rural area where I am located.

#### **1.2.2 IAM Roles and Permissions**
To enable seamless operation, the following roles were assigned:
- `roles/cloudsql.client`: For database access from the Cloud Run service.
- `roles/pubsub.publisher`: To allow publishing to the Pub/Sub topic.

#### **1.2.3 Outputs**
Terraform was configured to output:
- **`cloud_run_url`**: The public URL of the deployed Cloud Run service.
- **`db_connection_name`**: The connection string for the Cloud SQL database.

---

### **1.3 Validation**

The setup was validated by deploying a simple Flask-based API. The API responds with `Hello, World!` at the root endpoint and was confirmed operational by accessing the Cloud Run public URL.

- **Application Code**: The API was built using Flask and dynamically reads the `PORT` environment variable for compatibility with Cloud Run.
- **Dockerization**:
  - A lightweight Python image (`python:3.9-slim`) was used as the base.
  - Dependencies were installed via `requirements.txt`.
  - Gunicorn was used as the production-ready application server.
- **Deployment Steps**:
  1. Build and push the Docker image to Google Container Registry (GCR).
  2. Apply Terraform changes to provision the infrastructure.
  3. Use the `gcloud` CLI to make the Cloud Run service publicly accessible.

---

## Part 2: Applications and CI/CD Workflow

### **2.1 HTTP API**

An HTTP API was created to read data from a database and expose it via a GET request.

#### **Steps Taken:**
1. Set up a new Cloud SQL instance named `postgres-instance` as the production-ready database for this project.
   - Configured the database and ensured proper IP authorization for connectivity.
   - Used the `admin` user to create the `challenge_db` database, which replaced the initial setup for improved testing and final integration.
2. Connected to the database via `gcloud sql connect` and created a new table named `test_table` for data handling during testing.
   - The table contains the following columns:
     - `id`: Primary key, auto-incrementing.
     - `column1`: VARCHAR(50).
     - `column2`: VARCHAR(255).
3. Inserted test data into the `test_table`.

#### **Table Initialization Script:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  column1 VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  column2 VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO test_table (column1, column2) VALUES
('Test 1', 'This is the first test row'),
('Test 2', 'This is the second test row');
```

### **API Enhancements**

1. Modified the `app.py` file to include a new `/data` endpoint.
   - The endpoint retrieves and returns all rows from `test_table` in JSON format.
2. Updated the `DATABASE` configuration in `app.py` to connect via Cloud SQL Socket:
   ```python
   "host": "/cloudsql/devsecops-sre-challenge:us-central1:postgres-instance",
   "port": 5432,
   "database": "challenge_db",
   "user": "admin",
   "password": "password123"

---

### **2.2 CI/CD Pipeline**

The API was deployed to the cloud using a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.

#### **Implementation**
1. **Code Build**:
   - Each update triggers the build process where a new Docker image is created for the API:
     ```bash
     docker build -t flask-api .
     ```

2. **Image Tagging and Push**:
   - The Docker image is tagged and pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR):
     ```bash
     docker tag flask-api gcr.io/devsecops-sre-challenge/flask-api:latest
     docker push gcr.io/devsecops-sre-challenge/flask-api:latest
     ```

3. **Automated Deployment**:
   - The pipeline uses `gcloud run deploy` to update the Cloud Run service with the latest image:
     ```bash
     gcloud run deploy flask-api \
       --image gcr.io/devsecops-sre-challenge/flask-api:latest \
       --platform managed \
       --region us-central1 \
       --allow-unauthenticated \
       --add-cloudsql-instances devsecops-sre-challenge:us-central1:postgres-instance
     ```

#### **Validation**
Accessed the `/data` endpoint, which returned the following response:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {"id": 1, "column1": "Test 1", "column2": "This is the first test row"},
    {"id": 2, "column1": "Test 2", "column2": "This is the second test row"}
  ]
}
```

---

### **2.3 Pub/Sub Listener and Database Integration**

A subscription was added to the Pub/Sub system with logic to process received messages and store them in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring messages published to the topic are saved in the database.

#### **Implementation**

#### **2.3.1 Google Cloud Pub/Sub**
   - A Pub/Sub topic (`ingestion-topic`) was created to handle message publishing.
   - A subscription (`ingestion-topic-sub`) was created to listen for messages on the topic.

#### **2.3.2 Listener Script**
   - A Python script (`pubsub_listener.py`) was implemented with the following logic:
     - Listen for messages from the `ingestion-topic-sub` subscription.
     - Validate the received data.
     - Insert the data into a PostgreSQL database table (`users`).

#### **2.3.3 Database Integration**
   - A new `users` table was created in the PostgreSQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE users (
         user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
     );
     ```
   - The table was populated with sample data for testing purposes:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO users (email, name) VALUES
     ('john.doe@example.com', 'John Doe'),
     ('jane.smith@example.com', 'Jane Smith'),
     ('alice.johnson@example.com', 'Alice Johnson'),
     ('bob.miller@example.com', 'Bob Miller'),
     ('charlie.brown@example.com', 'Charlie Brown'),
     ('diana.prince@example.com', 'Diana Prince');
     ```

#### **2.3.4 Testing**
   - Messages were published to the Pub/Sub topic for validation:
     ```bash
     gcloud pubsub topics publish ingestion-topic --message '{"user_id": 7, "email": "linda.williams@example.com", "name": "Linda Williams"}'
     ```
   - The listener script processed the message and inserted it into the `users` table.
   - Data was verified in the database using:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users;
     ```

---

### **2.4 Architecture Diagram**

An architecture diagram was included to illustrate the end-to-end process of data ingestion, storage, and exposure through the HTTP API.

#### **Diagram Overview**
The diagram shows three primary stages:

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Clients or applications publish messages in JSON format to the **Pub/Sub Topic**.
   - The **Pub/Sub Subscription** delivers the messages to the system for processing.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Processed messages are stored in the **Cloud SQL Database** (PostgreSQL).

3. **Data Exposure:**
   - The **API**, hosted on **Cloud Run**, retrieves data from the database and exposes it via a GET endpoint.
   - External consumers (e.g., browsers or applications) can send HTTP GET requests to retrieve the data in JSON format.

#### **Component Roles**
- **Pub/Sub Topic and Subscription:** Handle message ingestion and ensure reliable delivery.
- **Cloud SQL Database:** Stores structured data for downstream processing and querying.
- **API (Cloud Run):** Serves as the interface for external consumers to access stored data.
- **Client/Application:** External entities interacting with the system to publish or consume data.

#### **Diagram**

## Part 3: Integration Tests and Critical Quality Points

### **3.1 Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

The CI/CD pipeline ensures that every update to the codebase is thoroughly tested and deployed seamlessly. The implementation details are as follows:

#### **3.1.1 Continuous Integration (CI)**
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) was created to maintain code quality by running automated tests whenever changes are:
  1. Pushed to the `main` branch.
  2. Submitted via pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
- **Testing Framework**: The pipeline uses the `pytest` framework to validate the functionality of the application.
- The CI pipeline verifies:
  1. The correctness of the API endpoints.
  2. Integration with the database.
- Only changes that pass all tests are merged into the `main` branch, ensuring the integrity of the codebase.

#### **3.1.2 Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- A separate GitHub Actions workflow (`cd.yml`) is triggered on every push to the `main` branch.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Docker Build**:
     - The application is containerized using a `Dockerfile` located in the `/api` directory.
     - The Docker image is tagged and pushed to Google Container Registry (GCR).
  2. **Deployment**:
     - The latest image is deployed to Google Cloud Run using `gcloud run deploy`.
     - The API is configured to securely connect to the Cloud SQL database for persistent storage.
  3. **Authentication**:
     - The workflow uses a Google service account key, securely stored as a GitHub secret, for authentication.

#### **Benefits of the CI/CD Pipeline**
- Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
- Ensures code reliability and quality before deployment.
- Speeds up the delivery process while reducing the risk of production issues.

#### **Integration Test Plan**
1. **Invalid Message Handling**: Verify that invalid Pub/Sub messages do not affect the system.
   - **Scenario**: Publish a message missing required fields (e.g., `user_id`).
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - The message is logged as an error.
     - The invalid message is not stored in the database.

2. **Database Connectivity**: Test system behavior during database downtime.
   - **Scenario**: Disconnect the Cloud SQL Proxy and send API requests.
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - The API returns a `500 Internal Server Error` response.
     - Database consistency is maintained when connectivity is restored.

3. **Pub/Sub to Database Flow**: Ensure that valid messages published to Pub/Sub are properly stored in the database.
   - **Scenario**: Publish a batch of valid messages and query the database.
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - All messages are correctly inserted into the `users` table.

4. **High Load API Performance**: Test the APIâ€™s scalability under heavy load.
   - **Scenario**: Send 1,000 concurrent requests to the `/data` endpoint.
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - The API responds with <200ms latency under load.
     - No errors or downtime occur.

5. **Data Consistency**: Verify that API responses match database contents.
   - **Scenario**: Insert test records into the database and call the `/data` endpoint.
   - **Expected Result**: 
     - The API response matches the database records exactly.

#### **Execution Plan**
- These tests will be automated using `pytest` and included in the CI pipeline.
- Mocking tools (e.g., `unittest.mock`) will simulate Pub/Sub and database dependencies.
- Load testing tools like `Locust` or `JMeter` will be used for performance validation.

## Part 5: Alerts and SRE

### **5.1 Alert Rules and Thresholds**

Proposed alert rules ensure timely detection and resolution of system issues:

1. **CPU Usage**: Alert if usage >85% for 5+ minutes; investigate bottlenecks or scale horizontally.
2. **Memory Usage**: Alert if usage >90% for 5+ minutes or spikes >95%; optimize or allocate more memory.
3. **Database Latency**: Alert if query latency >200ms for 10+ minutes; optimize queries or scale the database.
4. **Error Rate**: Alert if errors exceed 5% over 10 minutes; debug logs and resolve issues.
5. **API Response Time**: Alert if 95th percentile response time >1 second for 5+ minutes; analyze traces for bottlenecks.
6. **Disk Usage**: Alert if usage >80% or write speed drops; expand storage or optimize operations.
7. **Pub/Sub Backlog**: Alert if backlog >1,000 messages for 10+ minutes; scale listeners or troubleshoot delays.
8. **Service Availability**: Alert if service is down for 1+ minute or error rate >2%; investigate and redeploy if needed.

#### **Alert Severity Levels**
- **Critical**: Issues affecting availability or user experience (e.g., service downtime, high error rate).
- **Warning**: Performance degradation requiring attention (e.g., high CPU or memory usage).

These thresholds enable proactive issue resolution, ensuring system reliability and a better user experience.

---

### **5.2 SLIs and SLOs Definition**

To monitor system reliability and performance, the following SLIs and SLOs are defined:

#### **SLI 1: Availability**
- **Definition**: Percentage of successful requests (HTTP 200â€“299).
